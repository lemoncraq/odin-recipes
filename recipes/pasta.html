        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Pasta primavera is quite a straightforward recipe; spaghetti or
            fettuccine tossed with an array of fresh spring vegetables.
        </p>
        <p>
            When done right, this is one of the year's great seasonal recipes.
        </p>
        <p>This looks, smells, and tastes like a cool, sunny spring day.</p>

            <li>3 cups chicken broth, divided</li>
            <li>½ cup olive oil</li>

            <li>1 pound fettuccine pasta</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large leek, white and light green parts only, chopped</li>
            <li>1 bunch green onions, chopped</li>
            <li>2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and diced</li>
            <li>2 pinches salt</li>
            <li>2 zucchinis, diced</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped sugar snap peas</li>
            <li>½ cup shelled English peas</li>
            <li>1 bunch asparagus, stalks diced, tips left whole</li>
            <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a
                rolling boil.<br />
                Hold basil bunch by the stems and dip basil leaves in boiling
                water until bright green, about 2 seconds.
                <br />
                Immediately immerse basil in ice water for several minutes until
                cold to stop the cooking process.
                <br />
                Once the basil is cold, drain well. Remove basil leaves from
                stems and discard stems.
            </li>
            <li>
                Blend basil leaves, 1 cup chicken broth, 1/2 cup olive oil, and
                garlic together in a blender until smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir fettuccine into the same pot of boiling water, bring back
                to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until cooked through
                but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over
                medium heat.<br />
                Cook and stir leek and green onion in hot oil until softened,
                about 5 minutes.<br />
                Add jalapeno and salt; cook and stir until jalapeno is soft,
                about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Increase heat to medium-high. Stir 2 cups chicken broth,
                zucchini, sugar snap peas, and English peas into jalapeno
                mixture; bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.<br />Add
                asparagus and continue cooking until asparagus is soft, about 3
                minutes more.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour 1/4 cup basil-garlic mixture into zucchini mixture and cook
                and stir until heated through, about 1 minute. Remove from heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place pasta in a large bowl; pour zucchini mixture over pasta
                and pour remaining basil-garlic mixture over the zucchini
                mixture.<br />Spread Parmesan cheese over the top. <br />Toss
                mixture briefly to combine and tightly wrap bowl with aluminum
                foil.<br />Let stand until pasta and vegetables soak up most of
                the juices and oil, about 5 minutes. Toss again.
